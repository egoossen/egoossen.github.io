    <p><b>To enter Performance Play Mode,</b> press <kbd>[PERFORM]</kbd></p>
    <p><i>A1 through A6 are currently set up as "Worship 1" through "Worship 6". These settings have a keyboard split for two voices at Middle C. The upper voice is transposed one octave down and the lower voice is transposed one octave up.</i></p>

    <p><b>To add or change voices,</b> press <kbd>[F2] Voice</kbd>. Use arrow keys to move to the desired part. Press <kbd>[SF1] ADD INT</kbd> and select a voice (e.g. from USER2 or GM banks) to assign to that part.</p>

    <p><b>To set the range</b> of a voice, use the arrow keys to select a voice, then press a key while holding down <kbd>[SF4] LIMIT L</kbd> or <kbd>[SF5] LIMIT H</kbd> to set the lowest or highest notes for that voice, respectively. Voices may have ranges that overlap.</p>

    <p><b>To adjust the volume</b> for each voice, use the volume sliders for Zone 1 to Zone 4, which correspond to the voices shown from top to bottom.</p>
    <p><i>Note: When changing to a different performance preset, the volumes for each voice are reset to their default. Slide the sliders to the limits of their range to sync the volume with the position of the slider.</i></p>

    <p><b>To delete a voice assignment,</b> select the voice with the arrow keys and press <kbd>[SF3] DELETE</kbd>.</p>

    <p><b>To save the edited performance,</b> press <kbd>[STORE]</kbd>, select the destination Performance using the dial or the <kbd>[INC/YES]</kbd> and <kbd>[DEC/NO]</kbd> buttons (defaults to current performance). Press <kbd>[ENTER]</kbd> to overwrite the selected performance, then <kbd>[INC/YES]</kbd> to confirm.</p>

    <p>I do not know how to transpose voices, so I have avoided deleting the voice assignments that Dave set up (the first two voices on each worship preset). If I do not want a split voice for a song, I mute the first two voices using the volume sliders.</p>

    <p>I have found it helpful to assign each song sequentially to the worship presets so I can just select the next preset for each song.</p>

    <p>Information found in the manual pp. 34-37, 55, 149. The manual should be found in the piano bench on search online for S90ES Manual.</p>
